3. Create an index.html and render it.

4. Create a git repo (locally) and commit the initial code.

5. Create a Data Structure to store Todo Items in memory.

7. Render the todo items on the index.html page.

8. Add a page called todo_form.html which contains a form for adding todo items.

9. Add a link to index.html to display todo_form.html (using python and render_template, not a direct link)

10. Code the back end for the todo_form so that you can add items to the list.

11. Add a link called 'Edit' beside each item in the list on index.html.
